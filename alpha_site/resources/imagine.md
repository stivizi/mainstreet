# Imagination Nation

Working in a team, your child will participate in collaborative class projects that are determined by group vote. These projects will involve using agentic systems to address real-world challenges, fostering teamwork and practical application of AI.

Here are some examples of collaborative projects students could undertake:

## AI-Powered Business Simulation

*   **Illustration:** Imagine a lemonade stand business simulation.
*   **Examples:** Students could build an AI agent that monitors simulated inventory levels (lemons, sugar, cups) and automatically orders more when supplies are low. Another agent could analyze simulated customer interactions (e.g., simple text inputs) to identify common questions and provide automated responses. They could even build a simple agent to suggest optimal pricing based on simulated weather conditions.
*   **Outcome:** A basic AI system that helps manage a small, simulated business, demonstrating understanding of data monitoring, decision-making, and automated responses.

## Data Analysis and Recommendation Engine

*   **Illustration:** Think about recommending video games or books based on a user's preferences.
*   **Examples:** Students could use a dataset of fictional game ratings and genres. An AI agent could analyze this data to identify patterns and build a simple recommendation engine that suggests new games a user might like based on their past ratings. They could visualize the data and the recommendations.
*   **Outcome:** A system that takes data, analyzes it using AI techniques, and provides personalized recommendations, illustrating data processing and pattern recognition.

## Interactive Agent Development

*   **Illustration:** Like a simple character in a game or a helpful chatbot for a specific task.
*   **Examples:** Students could build a text-based agent that can navigate a small, defined virtual space (e.g., a few rooms in a house). The agent would understand simple commands ("go north", "pick up key") and react to the environment. Another example could be an agent designed to help users find information within a small, curated set of documents by understanding natural language questions.
*   **Outcome:** An agent that can understand instructions, interact with an environment (simulated or text-based), and perform specific actions, demonstrating agent design and interaction.

## Ethical AI Decision-Making Explorer

*   **Illustration:** Imagine an AI that helps decide which fictional students get a scholarship, and you want to understand why it made its choices.
*   **Examples:** Students could build a simple AI model (or use a pre-trained one) that makes decisions based on some input data (e.g., fictional grades, test scores). The project would focus on building a system around the AI that explains *why* it made a particular decision, making the AI's process more transparent. They could explore how changing the input data affects the outcome and the explanation.
*   **Outcome:** A system that demonstrates the importance of transparency in AI decision-making by providing explanations for the AI's choices, highlighting a key ethical consideration beyond bias.

## Automated Workflow for a Cause

*   **Illustration:** Automating tasks for a fictional animal shelter or environmental group.
*   **Examples:** Students could design a workflow where an agent processes incoming simulated donations (simple data entries), sends automated thank-you messages using an LLM, and updates a simulated donor list. Another workflow could involve an agent that monitors simulated environmental data and triggers alerts based on predefined conditions.
*   **Outcome:** A practical application of AI workflows and agents to automate tasks for a beneficial purpose, demonstrating process automation and real-world problem-solving.
